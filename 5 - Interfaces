An interface in Java is : A contract that defines what a class must do, without defining how it does it.

Example:
interface Vehicle {
    void start();  // public abstract
}
class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with key");
    }
}
Vehicle v = new Car();
v.start();

6️⃣ Rules of Interfaces (VERY IMPORTANT)
Methods
- By default: public abstract
- Cannot be private (except Java 9+ helper methods)
- Must be implemented by concrete classes

Variables
- Always public static final
interface Config {
    int MAX = 100;  // constant
}

Constructors - ❌ Interfaces cannot have constructors
Object Creation - ❌ Cannot create objects of interface

7️⃣ Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces (Big Advantage)
Java does not allow multiple inheritance using classes, but interfaces solve this.

interface A {
    void show();
}

interface B {
    void show();
}

class C implements A, B {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Resolved");
    }
}

- No ambiguity because class provides implementation.

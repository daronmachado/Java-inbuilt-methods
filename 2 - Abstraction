Abstraction is an OOP principle that exposes only essential behaviors to the outside world while hiding internal implementation details.
Java supports abstraction using:
1) Abstract Classes
2) Interfaces

An abstract class:
- Can have abstract methods (without body)
- Can have concrete methods (with body)

Example:
abstract class Vehicle {

    abstract void start();  // abstract method

    void fuel() {            // concrete method
        System.out.println("Filling fuel");
    }
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with key");
    }
}

Key Rules of Abstract Class
- Cannot be instantiated
- Can have constructors
- Can have instance variables
- Can have abstract & non-abstract methods
- Supports single inheritance only


Interface (Complete Abstraction)
An interface defines: What to do, Not how to do
Example:
interface Payment {
    void pay();
}
class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Pay using credit card");
    }
}

Interface Rules
- Methods are public abstract by default
- Variables are public static final
- No constructors
- Supports multiple inheritance

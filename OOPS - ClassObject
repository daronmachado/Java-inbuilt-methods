CLASS & OBJECT - The Foundantion
1) A class is a user-defined data type that groups:
  - State → variables (data)
  - Behavior → methods (operations on data)

Example:
class Car {
    int speed;          // state
    void drive() {      // behavior
        System.out.println("Driving");
    }
}

2) An object is a real runtime entity created from a class, representing instance of a class.
Example:
Car c = new Car();

This single line does three things:
1	Memory is allocated in heap
2	Instance variables are initialized
3	Constructor is called

Stack -> Reference variable c
Heap -> Actual Car object, Instance variable speed, Methods (shared across objects)

3)Constructor
Example:
class Car {
    int speed;
    Car() {
        speed = 0;
    }
}
Constructor:
Runs only once per object, Initializes instance variables, Has same name as class, Has no return type.

4)new keyword -> Allocates memory in heap, Calls constructor, returns reference to object
